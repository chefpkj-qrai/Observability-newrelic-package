# âœ… Fixed! Run These Commands

The package.json has been updated with the missing dependencies.

## Run These Commands:

```bash
cd "/Users/heyitspkj/Desktop/Quick Reply/observability-newrelic-package"

# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Build
npm run build
```

## Then Publish:

```bash
npm login
npm publish
```

---

## What Was Fixed

Added to `devDependencies`:
- `@types/newrelic` - TypeScript types for New Relic
- `mongodb` - MongoDB driver (for compilation)
- `newrelic` - New Relic agent (for compilation)

These are only needed to build the package. Users installing your package will provide their own `mongodb` and `newrelic` dependencies.
